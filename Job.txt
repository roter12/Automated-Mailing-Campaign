JOB: Automated Mailing Campaign

I am looking to do a massive mail campaign from a list of companies in an excel spreadsheet.
I am needing data collection of the mailing addresses of all companies listed. 1200 total companies,
from there I am looking for automation set up of a personalized tailored letter.

Needing the 'lease name' and 'county and state' (also already in the Excel spreadsheet) 
automated into each letter, as well as the name of the company and address (per draft letter).
Draft letter will be provided upon acceptance of job.
List of steps below are not necessary as long as overall job description above is completed, just an outline.

Example List of Steps:

1. Data Collection and Preparation:
Using AI, or web scraping. Add in mailing address of all given operators in excel.

Data Integration with Excel:
Import or link your collected data to your Excel spreadsheet, ensuring that it's organized in a structured format.

2. Natural Language Processing (NLP):
Use NLP tools to personalize the content of your letters.
You can extract relevant information from your Excel data and generate customized letters using AI-driven text generation models.

3. Address Verification:
Employ address verification services or APIs to validate and standardize the mailing addresses in your Excel file. 
This ensures that your letters reach the correct destinations.

4. Automation Platform:
Utilize an automation platform or scripting language (e.g., Python) to automate the entire process.
Write scripts that pull data from your Excel file, generate personalized letters using NLP, and insert the verified addresses.

5. Printing and Mailing:
Integrate with a printing and mailing service that can handle bulk mailing.
Some services can automatically print and mail letters based on a provided template and recipient addresses.

6. Tracking and Reporting:
Implement tracking mechanisms to monitor the status of sent letters, such as delivery confirmation or response tracking.

7. Testing and Quality Control:
Thoroughly test your automation workflow on a small batch of data to ensure accuracy and correctness before scaling it up.

8. Scaling and Execution:
Once you're confident in your automation process, scale it up to process the entire Excel dataset.

other third party websites can be utilized, will need to discuss before hand about pricing of using third party websites to mail/obtain data.
Sample excel spreadsheet is attached, real spreadsheet has 1200 companies (operators).

Client: I am open to whatever you think, I have in the past used docupost.com, but I do not like their pricing.
If you have a website you would recommend, maybe like stamps.com we can use whatever you prefer.
But I won’t want to spend more than $500 on the mailing services.
